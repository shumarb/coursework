// CS1010 Programming Methodology
// Problem Set 3 Exercise #14: rabbit_jump.c
//
// A bunny can jump at most 50 centimetres.
// It needs to cross a river, with rocks
// positioned in a straight line in the river.
// This program computes the minimum number
// of jumps for the rabbit to cross to the
// other side of the river.
