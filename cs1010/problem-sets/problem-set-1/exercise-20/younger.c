// CS1010 Programming Methodology
// Problem Set 1 Exercise #20: younger.c
//
// Program reads in each person's day, month, and year of birth
// Program compares the year first. Person with smaller birth year is younger person
// For same birth day, month and year, both persons have the same age
// For same birth day and year, person with greater numerical value of month is the younger person
